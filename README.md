# 🧠 AI Image Caption Generator

An interactive web app that lets you **upload an image** and generates a cool **AI-like caption** for it.  
Currently, it uses simulated captions (no backend), but you can later connect it to **Gemini**, **Hugging Face**, or **OpenAI’s Vision API** for real caption generation.
